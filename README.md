- **Security Research**: A valuable tool for security researchers and bug bounty hunters.

## Getting Started

To get started with the XSS Test repository, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Use the command below to clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/turrab1349/xss-test.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Change into the directory you just cloned.

   ```bash
   cd xss-test
   ```

3. **Open in Browser**: You can view the project by opening the `index.html` file in your web browser.

4. **Visit Releases**: For the latest updates and downloads, check the [Releases section](https://github.com/turrab1349/xss-test/releases).

## Usage

### Testing XSS Payloads

To test XSS payloads, follow these steps:

1. **Select a Payload**: Choose a payload from the list provided in the repository.
2. **Inject the Payload**: Insert the payload into the designated input fields on the demo page.
3. **Observe the Results**: Check how the application responds to the injected payload.

### Examples of XSS Payloads

Here are some examples of XSS payloads you can test:

- `<script>alert('XSS');</script>`
- `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`
- `<svg onload=alert('XSS')>`

These payloads can help you understand how XSS vulnerabilities work and how to exploit them.

## Additional Resources

### Understanding XSS

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. Understanding how XSS works is crucial for both developers and security professionals.

#### Types of XSS

1. **Stored XSS**: The malicious script is stored on the server and served to users.
2. **Reflected XSS**: The script is reflected off a web server, often via URL parameters.

### Preventing XSS

To protect against XSS attacks, consider the following strategies:

- **Input Validation**: Always validate user inputs to ensure they meet expected formats.
- **Output Encoding**: Encode data before rendering it on the page.
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implement CSP headers to restrict where scripts can be loaded from.

## Community Contributions

We encourage community contributions to improve this project. Here are some ways you can help:

- **Report Bugs**: If you find any issues, please report them in the Issues section.
- **Suggest Features**: Have an idea for a new feature? Let us know!
- **Share Your Findings**: If you discover new XSS payloads, consider adding them to the repository.

## Conclusion

The XSS Test repository serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning about and testing XSS vulnerabilities. We hope this project helps you in your security research and bug bounty endeavors. Don't forget to check the [Releases section](https://github.com/turrab1349/xss-test/releases) for the latest updates!
